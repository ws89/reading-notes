# C10k problem

The **C10k problem** is the problem of optimising [network sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket) to handle a large number of clients at the same time. The name C10k is a [numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) for **concurrently handling ten thousand connections**.

Note that concurrent connections are not the same as [requests per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requests_per_second), though they are similar: handling many requests per second requires high throughput (processing them quickly), while high number of concurrent connections requires efficient scheduling of connections.In other words, handling many requests per second is concerned with the speed of handling requests, whereas a system capable of handling a high number of concurrent connections does not necessarily have to be a fast system, only one where each request will deterministically return a response within a (not necessarily fixed) finite amount of time.



## History

The term was coined in 1999 by Dan Kegel, citing the [Simtel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simtel) FTP host, [cdrom.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdrom.com), serving 10,000 clients at once over 1 [gigabit per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_per_second) [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet) in that year.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem#cite_note-C10K-1) The term has since been used for the general issue of large number of clients, with similar numeronyms for larger number of connections, most recently [C10M](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C10M&action=edit&redlink=1) in the 2010s.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem#cite_note-:0-3)

By the early 2010s **millions of connections** on a single commodity 1U server became possible: over **2 million** connections ([WhatsApp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp), 24 cores, using [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29) on [FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD)),[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem#cite_note-4)[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem#cite_note-5) **10â€“12 million** connections (MigratoryData, 12 cores, using [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28Programming_language%29) on [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux))[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem#cite_note-:0-3)[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem#cite_note-6)

Common applications of very high number of connections include pub/sub servers, chat, file servers, web servers, and software-defined networking.
