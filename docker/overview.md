# Overview

Docker is the world’s leading software container platform. Developers use Docker to eliminate “works on my machine” problems when  collaborating on code with co-workers. Operators use Docker to run and manage apps side-by-side in isolated containers to get better compute 
density. Enterprises use Docker to build agile software delivery pipelines to ship new features faster, more securely and with confidence for both Linux and Windows Server apps. 



## What is a Container?

Using containers, everything required to make a piece of software run is packaged into isolated containers. Unlike VMs, containers **do not bundle a full operating system - only libraries and settings required to make the software work are needed**. This makes for efficient, lightweight, self-contained systems and guarantees that software will always run the same, regardless of where it’s deployed.
