# Redis cluster



## Redis Cluster 101

Redis Cluster provides a way to run a Redis installation where data is **automatically sharded across multiple Redis nodes**.

Redis Cluster also provides **some degree of availability during partitions**, that is in practical terms the ability to continue the operations when some nodes fail or are not able to communicate. However the cluster stops to operate in the event of larger failures (for example when the majority of masters are unavailable).

So in practical terms, what you get with Redis Cluster?

- The ability to **automatically split your dataset among multiple nodes**.
- The ability to **continue operations when a subset of the nodes are experiencing failures** or are unable to communicate with the rest of the cluster.



## Redis Cluster TCP ports

Every Redis Cluster node requires two TCP connections open. The normal Redis TCP port used to serve clients, for example **6379**, plus the port obtained by adding 10000 to the data port, so **16379** in the example.



This second *high* port is used for the Cluster bus, that is a node-to-node communication channel using a binary protocol. The Cluster bus is used by nodes for **failure detection, configuration update, failover authorization** and so forth. Clients should never try to communicate with the cluster bus port, but always with the normal Redis command port, however make sure you open both ports in your firewall, otherwise Redis cluster nodes will be not able to communicate.

The command port and cluster bus port offset is fixed and is always 10000.

Note that for a Redis Cluster to work properly you need, for each node:

1. The normal client communication port (usually 6379) used to communicate with clients to be open to all the clients that need to reach the cluster, plus all the other cluster nodes (that use the client port for keys migrations).
2. The cluster bus port (the client port + 10000) must be reachable from all the other cluster nodes.

If you don't open both TCP ports, your cluster will not work as expected.

The cluster bus uses a different, binary protocol, for node to node data exchange, which is more suited to exchange information between nodes using little bandwidth and processing time.
