# Overview

The Java Virtual Machine dynamically loads,links and initializes classes and interfaces.

- **Loading** is the process of *finding* the binary representation of a class or interface type with a particular name and *creating* a class or interface from that binary representation.
- **Linking** is the process of taking a class or interface and combining it into the run-time state of the Java Virtual Machine so that it can be executed.
- **Initialization** of a class or interface consists of executing the class or interface initialization method.
