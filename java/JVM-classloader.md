# Overview

The Java Virtual Machine dynamically loads,links and initializes classes and interfaces.

- **Loading** is the process of *finding* the binary representation of a class or interface type with a particular name and *creating* a class or interface from that binary representation.
- **Linking** is the process of taking a class or interface and combining it into the run-time state of the Java Virtual Machine so that it can be executed.
- **Initialization** of a class or interface consists of executing the class or interface initialization method.

### Class Loader Subsystem

Java's [**dynamic class loading**](http://www.javainterviewpoint.com/use-of-class-forname-in-java/) functionality is handled by the class loader subsystem. It loads, links. and initializes the class file when it refers to a class for the **first time** at **runtime**, **not compile time**. 

#### Loading

Classes will be loaded by this component. Boot Strap class Loader, Extension class Loader, and Application class Loader are the three class
 loader which will help in achieving it.

- **Boot Strap ClassLoader** – Responsible for loading classes from the bootstrap classpath, nothing but **rt.jar. **Highest priority will be given to this loader.
- **Extension ClassLoader** – Responsible for loading classes which are inside **ext** folder **(jre\lib).**
- **Application ClassLoader** –Responsible for loading **Application Level Classpath**, path mentioned Environment Variable etc.

The above **Class Loaders** will follow **Delegation Hierarchy Algorithm **while loading the class files.



#### Linking

- **Verify** – Bytecode verifier will verify whether the generated bytecode is proper or not if verification fails we will get the **verification error.**
- **Prepare** – For all static variables memory will be allocated and assigned with **default values.**
- **Resolve** – All **symbolic memory references** are replaced with the **original references** from **Method Area**.



#### Initialization

This is the final phase of Class Loading, here all **static variables **will be assigned with the original values, and the **static block** will be executed.
