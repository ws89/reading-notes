# Garbage Collectors

## Common Heap Related Switches

| **Switch**      | **Description**                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `-Xms`          | Sets the initial heap size for when the JVM starts. |
| `-Xmx`          | Sets the maximum heap size.              |
| `-Xmn`          | Sets the size of the Young Generation.   |
| -XX:PermSize    | Sets the starting size of the Permanent Generation. |
| -XX:MaxPermSize | Sets the maximum size of the Permanent Generation |



## The Serial GC

The serial collector is the default for client style machines in Java SE 5 and 6. With the serial collector, both minor and major garbage collections are done serially (using a single virtual CPU). In addition, it uses a ***mark-compact*** collection method. This method moves older memory to the beginning of the heap so that new memory allocations are made into a single continuous chunk of memory at the end of the heap. This compacting of memory makes it faster to allocate new chunks of memory to the heap.

#### Usage Cases

The Serial GC is the garbage collector of choice for most applications that do not have low pause time requirements and run on **client-style machines**. It takes advantage of **only a single virtual processor** for garbage collection work (therefore, its name). Still, on today's hardware, the Serial GC can efficiently manage a lot of non-trivial applications with a few hundred MBs of Java heap, with relatively short worst-case pauses (around a couple of seconds for full garbage collections).

Another popular use for the Serial GC is in environments where **a high number of JVMs are run on the same machine (in some cases, more JVMs than available processors!)**. In such environments when a JVM does a garbage collection it is better to use only one processor to minimize the interference on the remaining JVMs, even if the garbage collection might last longer. And the Serial GC fits this trade-off nicely.

Finally, with the proliferation of **embedded hardware** with minimal memory and few cores, the Serial GC could make a comeback.

#### Command Line Switches

To enable the Serial Collector use:
` -XX:+UseSerialGC`

Here is a sample command line for starting the `Java2Demo`:
 `java -Xmx12m -Xms3m -Xmn1m -XX:PermSize=20m -XX:MaxPermSize=20m -XX:+UseSerialGC -jar c:\javademos\demo\jfc\Java2D\Java2demo.jar`



## The Parallel GC

The parallel garbage collector uses multiple threads to perform the ***young generation*** garbage collection. By default **on a host with N CPUs, the parallel garbage collector uses N garbage collector threads** in the collection. The number of garbage collector threads can be controlled with command-line options:
`-XX:ParallelGCThreads=<desired number>`

**On a host with a single CPU the default garbage collector is used even if the parallel garbage collector has been requested**. On a host with two CPUs the parallel garbage collector generally performs as well as the default garbage collector and **a reduction in the young generation garbage collector pause times can be expected on hosts with more than two CPUs**. The Parallel GC comes in two flavors.



#### Usage Cases

The Parallel collector is also called a throughput collector. Since it can use multiple CPUs to speed up application throughput. This collector should be used when a lot of work need to be done and long pauses are acceptable. For example, batch processing like printing reports or bills or performing a large number of database queries.

#### -XX:+UseParallelGC

With this command line option you get a **multi-thread young generation collector with a single-threaded old generation** collector.  The option also does single-threaded compaction of old generation.

Here is a sample command line for starting the `Java2Demo`:
` java -Xmx12m -Xms3m -Xmn1m -XX:PermSize=20m -XX:MaxPermSize=20m -XX:+UseParallelGC -jar c:\javademos\demo\jfc\Java2D\Java2demo.jar `



#### -XX:+UseParallelOldGC

With the `-XX:+UseParallelOldGC` option, the GC is **both a multithreaded young generation collector and multithreaded old generation collector**. It is also a multithreaded compacting collector. HotSpot does compaction only in the old generation. Young generation in HotSpot is considered a copy collector; therefore, there is no need for compaction.

Compacting describes the act of moving objects in a way that there are no holes between objects. After a garbage collection sweep, there may be holes left between live objects. Compacting moves objects so that there are no remaining holes. It is possible that a garbage collector be a non-compacting collector. Therefore, the difference between **a parallel collector** and **a parallel compacting collector** could be the latter compacts the space after a garbage collection sweep. The former would not.

Here is a sample command line for starting the `Java2Demo`:
`java -Xmx12m -Xms3m -Xmn1m -XX:PermSize=20m -XX:MaxPermSize=20m -XX:+UseParallelOldGC -jar c:\javademos\demo\jfc\Java2D\Java2demo.jar`



## The Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Collector

The Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) collector (also referred to as the concurrent low pause collector) collects the ***tenured generation***. It attempts to **minimize the pauses** due to garbage collection by doing most of the garbage collection work **concurrently** with the application threads. Normally the concurrent low pause collector does not copy or compact the live objects. A garbage collection is done without moving the live objects. If **fragmentation** becomes a problem, allocate a larger heap.

**Note:** CMS collector on young generation uses the same algorithm as that of the parallel collector.



#### Usage Cases

The CMS collector should be used for applications that require low pause times and can share resources with the garbage collector. Examples include desktop UI application that respond to events, **a webserver responding to a request or a database responding to queries**.



#### Command Line Switches

To enable the CMS Collector use:
`-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC`
and to set the number of threads use:
`-XX:ParallelCMSThreads=<n>`

Here is a sample command line for starting the `Java2Demo`:
`java -Xmx12m -Xms3m -Xmn1m -XX:PermSize=20m -XX:MaxPermSize=20m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:ParallelCMSThreads=2 -jar c:\javademos\demo\jfc\Java2D\Java2demo.jar`
