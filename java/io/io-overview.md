# Java IO Overview

## Input and Output - Source and Destination

Java's IO package mostly concerns itself with the reading of raw data from a source and writing    of raw data to a destination. The most typical sources and destinations of data are these:

- Files
- Pipes
- Network Connections
- In-memory Buffers (e.g. arrays)
- System.in, System.out, System.error

### Streams

[IO Streams](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-io/streams.html) are a core concept in Java IO. A stream is a conceptually endless flow of data. You can either read from a stream or write to a stream. A stream is connected to a data source or a data destination. Streams in Java IO can be either **byte based** (reading and writing bytes) or **character based** (reading and writing characters).



### The InputStream, OutputStream, Reader and Writer

A program that needs to read data from some source needs an [`InputStream`](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-io/inputstream.html) or a [Reader](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-io/reader.html). A program that needs to write data to some destination needs an    [`OutputStream`](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-io/outputstream.html) or a [`Writer`](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-io/writer.html).    



## Java IO Purposes and Features

Java IO contains many subclasses of the `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, `Reader`    and `Writer` classes. The reason is, that all of these subclasses are addressing various different purposes. That is why there are so many different classes. The purposes addressed are summarized below:

- File Access
- Network Access
- Internal Memory Buffer Access
- Inter-Thread Communication (Pipes)
- Buffering
- Filtering
- Parsing
- Reading and Writing Text (Readers / Writers) 
- Reading and Writing Primitive Data (long, int etc.)
- Reading and Writing Objects
